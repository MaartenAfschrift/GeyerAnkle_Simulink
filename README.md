# Geyer Ankle Simulink Model

This repository contains the Simulink model for the Geyer Ankle. Made by Maarten Afschrift, based on the work by Cristina Bay√≥n.

## Build

1. Clone the WR Actuator Library (https://bitbucket.org/ctw-bw/wr-actuator-library). It doesn't need to be built. Add the root directory of the library to your MATLAB path.
2. Run the `init` script.
3. Open the main `.slx` file and build it.
